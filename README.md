## Python Topics Covered

Below are the key Python concepts and topics I have practiced:

### 1. Basic Python Syntax
- Variables, data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Printing and basic I/O operations
- Arithmetic operations and logical operators
- Type casting and string formatting

### 2. Control Flow
- If-else conditions
- `for` and `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements
- Ternary operators and `match-case` (Python 3.10+)

### 3. Functions and Modules
- Defining functions with `def`
- Function arguments and return values
- Keyword and default arguments
- Recursion
- Importing and using modules

### 4. Data Structures
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- List comprehensions
- Iterating through different data structures
- Advanced dictionary and set operations

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Creating classes and objects
- Understanding `__init__` constructor
- Methods and attributes
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Encapsulation and polymorphism
- Magic methods and operator overloading

### 6. File Handling
- Reading from and writing to text files
- Handling exceptions (`try`, `except`, `finally`)
- Working with CSV and JSON files
- File and directory operations with `os` and `shutil` modules

### 7. Working with Libraries
- Installing and using third-party libraries with `pip`
- Practicing popular libraries like:
  - **NumPy** for numerical operations
  - **Pandas** for data analysis
  - **Matplotlib** for plotting
  - **Requests** for making HTTP requests
  - **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping

### 8. Algorithms and Problem-Solving
- Solving coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars
- Implementing algorithms for sorting, searching, and data manipulation
- Working with recursive functions and dynamic programming

### 9. Error Handling and Debugging
- Catching and raising exceptions
- Custom exception handling
- Debugging using `print` statements and `pdb` module
